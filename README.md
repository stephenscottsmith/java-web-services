# Building Web Services with Java EE Tutorial Notes

## Introduction
* We will be learning:
    1. Variable assignment and manipulation
    2. Defining and delineating a method
    3. Calling methods and functions
    4. Creating, editing and reading XML (Extensible Markup Language) files
    5. Ports, messages, and other ways in which computers communicate over the internet

## Chapter 1. About Web Services
* What are web services?
    * Important difference between web services and a website
        * A **website** can be thought of as a communication between 2 humans where the content is arranged such that each human can understand it.
        * A **webservice** is a communication between 2 computers. Instead of text and graphics, it transmits code requests that interact directly with another computer, often without any human intervention.
            * External server is a "black box" - do not need to know implemention/code
            * Accepts A, B, C -> Outputs data in XML format
* Working with XML Files
    * **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**
    * Light universal method of transferring data from computer to comptuer or program to program
    * Self-Descriptive
        * Tags are defined by the author
    * Principles of XML
        * Tags are placed inside `<message>` like this and is closed like `</message>`
        * Key difference between XML and HTML: XML files **DO NOT** have preset tags
